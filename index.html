        <p class = "opener"> This website was built for incoming students
          who would like some valuable tips on how to 
          succeed in college. High-school and College are 
          two very different things. College requires more
          self-control especially when it comes to studying. Discipline is also a needed life skill to have when it comes to college. You will be doing much more work on your own than you did in highschool. This requires good study habits and the perseverance to get through some tough classes.</p>

      <h1 class = "darkcyan tmar">Survival Tips</h1>
			<h1 class="second-toptxt">Introduction</h1>
      <p>Congratulations on your acceptance! We are pleased that you chose Umass Boston as your choice of University for next year! Whether you are a freshman or an incoming transfer, you are going to need some survival tips on success. Below you will find some advice that can get you through your first semester.</p>
			<h1 class="second-midtxt works">Get a calendar app or planner to help you stay on track</h1>
      <p>In your first week of the Semester, you may feel overwhelmed with your workload. It is important to get into the habit of planning a week in advance on when to do homework or study for tests/quizzes.</p>
			<h1 class="second-midtxt works">Pay Attention and Take Notes</h1>
      <p>It is important that you stay focus on all 
          of your lectures. They will get extremely boring,
          maybe to the point where you'll accidently miss
          important notes. If you have trouble concentrating,
          talk to your professors constantly about what they 
          expect and any material you missed.</p>
      <h1 class="second-midtxt works">Create study guides for exams</h1>
      <p>Study guides are an important aspect of preparing
          for exams. Regardless of whether a professor will supply one for you, they can make a difference in 
          your grade. We recommend that you begin working on
          a study a week before an exam date.</p>
      <h1 class="second-midtxt works">Establish a network of colleagues</h1>
      <p>To succeed in univeristy life, you have to network. Networking at Umass Boston is much easier than you think. For CSM freshman, you're given the opportunity to join an FSC (Freshman Success Community) which takes the place of your seminar classes and is a gathering of other students with the same major as you.</p>
